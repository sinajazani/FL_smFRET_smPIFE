
1. Each data file contains 5 variables: "photontrajectories," "cumindexall," "donT0," "accT0," and "irfparams."

a. "photontrajectories" contains the records of photon arrivals.
    The first column is bin indices (1 ms bin).
    The second column is macro arrival times in millisecond.
    The third column is the delay times from the laser excitation in 2 ps.
    The last column is photon colors. 1: acceptor, and 2: donor.

b. "cumindexall" separates the combined "photontrajectories" into individual molecular trajectories.
    For example, the photon trajectory of molecule 1 is photontrajectories(cumindexall(1)+1:cumindexall(2)).
    The photon trajectory of molecule n can be extracted as photontrajectories(cumindexall(n)+1:cumindexall(n+1)).

c. "donT0" is the time origin of the delay time of donor photons (column 3 in the data) in 40 ps resolution.
    In other words, multiply 40 ps to this value. (sorry for the various inconsistent time scales)
    Mean IRF delay time should be added to this time origin, which is "irfoff" obtained from fitting of IRF (see e).

d. "accT0" is the time origin of the delay time of acceptor photons in 40 ps resolution.

e. "irfparams" is the fitting parameters of the instrument response function.
    Rows are second and third parameters and columns are acceptor and donor channels.
    The data and fitting routines (irfdatafit.m) are also included.
    The data was processed in 40 ps resolution. This is the reason that donT0 and accT0 were obtained in 40 ps.

2. Finally, a3D data were collected in 4 different experiments and the data and other parameters except for irfparams
   consist of 4 sets. "photontrajectories" has 4 cell arrays.
